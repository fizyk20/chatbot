# chatbot

This will hopefully someday be an easily extensible Rust chatbot supporting multiple backends.

Planned support for:

* IRC
* Slack
* Discord

Will feature a universal API, making it easy to write modules adding various features, like
responding to commands, randomly sending messages generated with Markov chains or passing messages between
different networks.

Very much WIP
